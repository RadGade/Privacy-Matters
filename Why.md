[[What and introduction]]

For one to seek the shelter of privacy is considered wrong by people who wield power because for them wrong typically means doing something that poses meaningful challenges to the exercise of their power.  The Australian government has been contently passing laws that are striping the Australian citizen of their very individuals’ right to privacy, anonymity, and protection from having their personal information collected. Laws such as the data retension act provides the Australian goverment unrestricted access to everything the citizens do on the open web, and gives them tools to track each citizens behaviour on the internet. The law requires companies to retain data of Australian users for at least 2 years. There laws are unlikely to achieve its stated objective and thwart serious terrorist activities. There are a range of widely-accessible technologies that can be used to circumvent the government’s surveillance regime. But however, the everyday public, who don't have a clue on how dangerously this infreinges
on their fundamental human rights, are the ones going to be affected the worse. 


Internet is the only remaining free and unbiased platform where each one of us can voice our views and for a state police it, will not only lay the groundworks of a tottalitarian goverment but also push us towards a dystopian regime. An open and univerasal internet is most effective tool we have to address the very issues that aflict the world at hand.
