	Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.

	– Edward Snowden
	
Imagine a door that stands between your most private thoughts, and anyone with a key to that door can peep into your life and every conversation you ever had or will have. Now would you hand that key to an authority who says they want to keep you in check and make sure you aren't doing anything wrong. Probably not the wisest idea, because it would just be a matter of time when the authority abused this access. So why have we given complete unrestricted access to a our personal online life to the Australian Government?
