	Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.

- All of us have things to hide not just terorist 
- When we are being watched or montiered our behaviour changes dramatically. The range of behavioral options that we consider when we think we're being watched severely reduce. [Source](https://youtu.be/pcSlowAhvUk?t=446)


		There was, of course, no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. At any point, they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live, did live, from habit that became instinct, in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized.

- it is a realm of privacy, the ability to go somewhere where we can think and reason and interact and speak without the judgmental eyes of others being cast upon us, in which creativity and exploration and dissent exclusively reside, and that is the reason why when we allow a society to exist in which we're subject to constant monitoring,  we allow the essence of human freedom to be severely crippled.

- For one to seek the shelter of privacy is considered wrong by people who wield power because for them wrong typically means doing something that poses meaningful challenges to the exercise of their power.  
- By creating databases and systems of easy access to such a great volume of personally revealing information, we increase the scope of mass surveillance, and therefore the scope for infringements upon our human rights. [Source](https://robindoherty.com/2016/01/06/nothing-to-hide.html)

		Ask yourself: at every point in history, who suffers the most from unjustified surveillance? It is not the privileged, but the vulnerable. Surveillance is not about safety, it’s about power. It’s about control.

-  Australia’s data retention law is one of the most comprehensive and intrusive data collection schemes in the western world. There are several reasons why Australians should challenge this law.

- it undermines the democratic principles on which Australia was founded. It gravely harms individuals’ right to privacy, anonymity, and protection from having their personal information collected.
