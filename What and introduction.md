Imagine a door that stands between your most private thoughts and anyone with a key to that door can peep into your life and every conversation you ever had or will have. Now would you hand that key to an authority who says they want to keep you in check and make sure you aren't doing anything wrong. Probably not the wisest idea, because it would just be a matter of time when the authority abused this access. So why are you willing to give up your personal data to a centralized authority? 

Privacy, a much foreign concept in today's post modern society, is one's ability to disclose information consensually and with expectations about the context and scope of sharing. Privacy is a right granted to individuals that underpins the freedoms of expression, association and assembly; all of which are essential for a free, democratic society.  Privacy is the key that unlocks your most deepest desires, your inadequacies, your mistakes, your traumas, your fears, your losses, your failures and everything that makes you unique. And for someone to have the ability to tear that all away from you is a scary thought, but when you willing hand over the key to an authority saying that you have nothing to hide, you make it possible for anyone who doesn't have your best interest at heart to exploit that data to further their own agenda. Privacy matters because the lack of it gives others power over you.
